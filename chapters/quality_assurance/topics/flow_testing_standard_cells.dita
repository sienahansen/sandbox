Testing Standard Cells</title>
      <body>
        <p>To ensure proper functioning of newly developed standard cells,
it is recommended to take them through the digital design and
implementation flows. This involves synthesizing a gate-level
netlist that incorporates the new cells, implementing the design
using digital P&amp;R tools, and performing sign-off validation,
including both functional and physical validation. The primary
purpose of this testing is consistency and naming checks between
file formats (LEF, LIB, PGV, CDL, and so on), and documentation of
any INFO or WARNING statements which can waived.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the specific flows used in this
process are best left to expert users familiar with the foundry
process and EDA tools, and is beyond the scope of this
document.</p>
